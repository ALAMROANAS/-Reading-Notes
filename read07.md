## What's a Table?

*A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.*

## Basic Table Structure...
..The <table> element is used
to create a table.

..You indicate the start of each
row using the opening <tr> tag.

..It is followed by one or more
<td> elements (one for each cell
in that row).

At the end of the row you use a
closing </tr> tag.

## example
<table>
 <tr>
 <th></th>
 <th>9am</th>
 <th>10am</th>
 <th>11am</th>
 <th>12am</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <th>Monday</th>
 <td colspan="2">Geography</td>
 <td>Math</td>
 <td>Art</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <th>Tuesday</th>
 <td colspan="3">Gym</td>
 <td>Home Ec</td>
 </tr>
</table>


# object 
The Array object lets you store multiple values in a single variable. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.


## array in an object

var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
