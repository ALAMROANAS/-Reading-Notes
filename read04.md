# Links

 Links are the defining feature of the web 
because they allow you to move from 
one web page to another — enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing.

# example
● Links from one website to another
● Links from one page to another on the same website
● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the 
same page
● Links that open in a new browser window
● Links that start up your email program and address a new 
email to someone
